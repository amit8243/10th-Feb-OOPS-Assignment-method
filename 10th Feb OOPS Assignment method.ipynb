    "#OOPS Assign method\n",
    "\"\"\"Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The open() function is used to open a file in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'r' - This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the  file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 'w' - This mode opens the file for writing only. If the file already exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new one is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 'a' - This mode opens the file for appending  only. If the file already exists, the data is appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new one is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 'r+' - This mode opens the file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 'w+' - This mode opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file already exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new one is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. 'a+' - This mode opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file already exists, the data is appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist  a new one is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The close() function is used in Python to close an open file. It is important to close a file \n",
    "because it frees up system resources associated with the file, and it ensures that any data written to \n",
    "the file is properly saved. Additionally, closing a file allows other programs to access the same  file. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a file is not closed properly, it can lead to data corruption and other issues. Therefore, it is \n",
    "important to always close a file after you are done using it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the close() function is used to close an open file. It is important to remember to call this \n",
    "function when you are done using a file, as it will help ensure that your data is properly saved and \n",
    "that other programs can access the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q3. Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then\n",
    "close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  \n",
    "# Open a file in write mode \n",
    "file = open(\"amit.txt\", \"w\") \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Write content in the file \n",
    "file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "# Close the file \n",
    "file.close() \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Open a file in read mode \n",
    "file = open(\"amit.txt\", \"r\") \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Read content of the file \n",
    "content = file.read() \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Print\n",
    "print(content) \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Close the file \n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "#Code Implementation with read()\n",
    "f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "print(f.read())\n",
    "\n",
    "#Code Implementation with readline()\n",
    "#open the file for read operation\n",
    "fl = open('pythonfile.txt')\n",
    "# reads line by line\n",
    "ln = fl.readline()\n",
    "while ln!= \"\":\n",
    "print(ln)\n",
    "ln = fl.readline()\n",
    "#close the file\n",
    "fl.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "#Code Implementation with readlines()\n",
    "#open the file for read operation\n",
    "fl = open('pythonfile.txt')\n",
    "# reads line by line and stores them in list\n",
    "for ln in fl.readlines():\n",
    "print(ln)\n",
    "#close the file\n",
    "fl.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and\n",
    "open() together?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The with statement is used with open() in Python to ensure that the file is properly closed after the block of code\n",
    "within the with statement is executed, even if an exception is raised. This helps to prevent data loss and resource \n",
    "leaks. The advantage of using with statement and open() together in Python is that it provides a convenient way to \n",
    "ensure that the file is properly closed after the block of code within the with statement is executed, even if an \n",
    "exception is raised. This helps to prevent data loss and resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the with statement simplifies the code by encapsulating common tasks such as opening and closing files.\n",
    "This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q6. Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.\"\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The write() function is used to write a string to an open file. It takes a single parameter, which is the string to\n",
    "be written. The writelines() function is used to write a sequence of strings to an open file. It takes a single \n",
    "parameter, which is the sequence of strings to be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in write mode \n",
    "f = open(\"test.txt\", \"w\") \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Writing to the file \n",
    "f.write(\"This is a test file\\n\") \n",
    "  \n",
    "# List of strings \n",
    "L = [\"This is Delhi \\n\", \"This is Chennai \\n\", \"This is Bangalore \\n\"] \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Writing multiple lines \n",
    "f.writelines(L) \n",
    "  \n",
    "# Closing the file \n",
    "f.close()"
